This is a program that simulates an elevator

ASSUMPTIONS

the following assumptions were made to limit time to create and allow for improvement upon the program incrementally

0. I assumed the console is from the viewpoint of a user
1. I am assuming there is only 1 elevator in the building and this system controls only that elevator
2. I assumed that anyone calling the elevator got on said elevator and exited at their inputed floor
3. I assumed the elevator would wait until an input occured, not close after a certain amount of time and go on servicing the building
4. I assumed there could only be 1 input to the elevator. In a normal elevator, it could be called from 2 floors at the same time
5. I assumed there was no emergency stop feature to the elevator that would take it out of service until fixed
6. I assumed the floors for this elevator would be sequential from 1 to number of floors, no numbers, no skipping floors
7. I assumed anyone could accesss any floor, no password or key required for some floors

POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS

the following is a non exhaustive list of possible improvements that could be made to this elevator simulator

0. allow for multiple elevators to be created to service the building
1. allow for inputs to come at any time, meaning while the elevator is moving to another floor and input could come in
2. allow for elevator to continue servicing others if no input is recieved after a set amount of time
3. implement an emergency stop feature
4. allow some floors to be password/key protected
